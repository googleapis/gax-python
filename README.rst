Google API Extensions for Python
================================

Google API Extensions for Python (gax-python) is a set of libraries which
aids the development of APIs for clients and servers based on `GRPC`_ and
Google API conventions.

Application code will rarely need to use most of the classes within this
library directly, but code generated automatically from the API definition
files in `GOOGLE APIS`_ can use services such as page streaming and request bundling to provide
a more convenient and idiomatic API surface to callers.
